# Creating Accessible Websites: A Guide for Designers

Web accessibility ensures that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. This guide covers key considerations for designers looking to create more accessible websites.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Beyond compliance with regulations like the ADA and WCAG, accessible design:
- Expands your audience
- Improves usability for everyone
- Enhances SEO
- Demonstrates social responsibility
- Reduces legal risks

## Key Design Considerations

### Color and Contrast

- Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Test your design in grayscale
- Consider color blindness in your palette selection

### Typography and Readability

- Use legible fonts at appropriate sizes (minimum 16px for body text)
- Maintain adequate line spacing (1.5 times the font size)
- Ensure sufficient spacing between paragraphs
- Use left-aligned text for easier reading

### Navigation and Structure

- Create logical tab order
- Make focus states clearly visible
- Provide multiple ways to navigate content
- Use descriptive headings and labels
- Ensure consistent navigation patterns

### Forms and Interaction

- Associate labels with form controls
- Provide clear error messages
- Don't rely on hover as the only interaction method
- Make clickable areas adequately sized
- Give feedback for all user actions

## Testing Your Design

- Keyboard navigation test: Can you access all functionality without a mouse?
- Screen reader test: Does your content make sense when read aloud?
- Zoom test: Does your layout work at 200% zoom?
- Color contrast analyzer: Do all elements meet WCAG guidelines?

## Resources for Designers

- [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/): Comprehensive web accessibility resources
